## BreastMNIST Image Classification Using CNN

This comprehensive guide details the process of building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for binary classification tasks. It covers everything from data loading and model architecture design to training, evaluation, fine-tuning, regularization, and performance evaluation to achieve optimal performance on the BreastMNIST 224x224 resolution image dataset, classifying it into two classes: benign and malignant.

Comments are provided for each step of this CNN model implementation to ensure a better understanding of the process.
